# Problem Statements:

1. Due to new regulations in the nonprofit industry CIS of Chicagoâ€™s employees must track their hours accurately. Develop a solution to address this.

2. CIS of Chicago chooses which CPS schools to partner with based on their level of need. Develop a way for them to better consider a multitude of factors and ultimately make this decision.

3. CIS of Chicago is always looking for better ways to improve graduation rates in CPS schools. Develop your own prompt and answer it!

# Data Resources:

There are two types of data relevant to CPS schools: School specific data and data on the surrounding neighborhood.

Within CPS Schools sheet we have listed every CPS school and their associated school id, neighborhood, affiliation with CIS of Chicago in addition to other general info. This sheet was designed as a starting point
for aggregating the data that you wish to collect.

Prepared "data_by_neighborhood":
We collected data from the Chicago Health Atlas 1.0 API (https://chicagohealth.herokuapp.com/apidoc/1.0.html) and put it into csv files. The data in this folder represents a subset of the total data on the Atlas. What we do have is segmented by neighborhood under the column 'location'
